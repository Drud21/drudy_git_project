### Project Title
My new bike share git project

### Description
This project is for a udacity course.  It demonstrates what I learned for git.

So far, I've learned SQL and Python.  Now I'm learning Git.  I can't wait to use the skills for future data science projects!

This project was updated to address comments from my reviewer.  Originally, I did not use the style guide for my git commits.
The reviewer shared the style guide with me and told me to make one commit for each branch, use the style guide when making the new commits, merge the three new commits, push changes to github, and then resubmit.

### Files used
I used bike share data from the following cities
Chicago
New York City
Washington

You won't be able to see this data because I listed the files in .gitignore

### Credits
This project was forked from udacity/pdsnd_github
