### Project Title
My new bike share git project

### Description
This project is for a udacity course.  It demonstrates what I learned for git.

So far, I've learned SQL and Python.  Now I'm learning Git.  I can't wait to use the skills for future data science projects!

### Files used
I used bike share data from the following cities
Chicago
New York City
Washington

You won't be able to see this data because I listed the files in .gitignore

### Credits
This project was forked from udacity/pdsnd_github
